            and coaching youth soccer. One happens in front of a keyboard, the

            piece of documentation reflects the correct information. While I had
            a process in place, it wasn’t as efficient as it could be, and the

            I am pleased to announce the beta release of my FacetWP integration
            plugin for WPGraphQL.  The main functionality was written quickly in
            late 2018 to fill a need to provide client-side access
            to&nbsp;FacetWP’s&nbsp;index and filtering functionality
            via&nbsp;WPGraphQL.&nbsp;As a&nbsp;proof-of-concept&nbsp;it worked
            exactly as needed.&nbsp;It was a lot less effort to create this
            plugin than it would have been to roll my own [&hellip;]

          <p>
            Many folks using WPGraphQL have asked about how to use GraphQL with
            their ACF data. The answer has typically been to manually map their
            ACF fields to the GraphQL schema using functions like
            register_graphql_field and register_graphql_object_type. For a few
            fields, this isn&#8217;t much of an issue, but when you have dozens
            of fields, this gets [&hellip;]
